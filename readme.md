**Introduction**

Laravel applications follow the traditional Model-View-Controller design pattern, where you use:

- **Controllers** to handle user requests and retrieve data, by leveraging Models
- **Models** to interact with your database and retrieve your objectsâ€™ information
- **Views** to render pages

This project is built with the latest technologies:

- **[Laravel 5 Extended Generators](https://github.com/laracasts/Laravel-5-Generators-Extended)**
